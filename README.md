# Push Button Breakout Button
A breakout board for 12mm or 4.3mm tactile push buttons to be connected to a micro controller for learning environments.

The breakout features both 2.54mm and 3.5mm connections for either male or female pin headers or 3.5mm screw terminals.

Now includes a normalised and simplified Fritzing version of the part (with just the 2.54mm pads) and an Illustrator (AI) and Inkscape (SVG) file for preparing slides.

Originally designed by [Tom Lynch](https://github.com/unknowndomain) for the Creative Technology Lab at London College of Communication, version 2 updated for UAL: Creative Computing Institute.
